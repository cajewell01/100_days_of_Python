# # 100_days_of_python
These are the exercises and projects I completed on my own without a solution, unless noted, while participating in the 100daysofpython.dev course. Below you will find instructions I needed to follow to accomplish each task, my thoughts, and things I learned. Also, while I will not be attaching the notes to this readme file or GitHub repository, the notes I took for each day along with the practice exercises are found in my [Notion](https://funky-crocodile-35a.notion.site/100-Days-of-Python-a5edd4102a6a4e60b365fba93016e916) 

## Day 1
This was just a basic intro. We covered printing, inputs, and concatenation. There were no exercies just the project. 

#### [Project: Band Name Generator](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_Python/blob/main/band_name_generator.py)
Using the city you grew up in and the name of a pet, create a program that will print the name of your new band. 

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
I have coded a little before so this felt familiar and I'm now excited to get started!

## Day 2
Today was data types, mathematical operations, and f-strings

#### [Project: Tip Calculator](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_Python/blob/main/tip_calculator.py)
If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.
Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
This was a great project and really tied everything that was learned today together. While I was able to easily work through this, I think my biggest thing to continue to practice is making my code more concise and readable. I think overall I wrote good code and I am proud of what I did. 

## Day 3
Today was all about IF statements and Logical Operators. I got carried away on this day, in a good way. 

#### [Project: Text Game Treasure Island (Shorter)](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_Python/blob/main/treasure_island_game_small.py)
Make your own "Choose Your Own Adventure" game. Use conditionals such as if, else, and elif statements to lay out the logic and the story's path in your program. This is the shorter version I made quickly for the project. 

#### [Project: Text Game Treasure Island (Larger)](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_Python/blob/main/Treasure_island_game_large.py)
Make your own "Choose Your Own Adventure" game. Use conditionals such as if, else, and elif statements to lay out the logic and the story's path in your program. This is the longer version I made for fun

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
I lost myself in making the larger game. I'm hoping that I learn a better way to clean up my code here. Both the smaller and larger projects really helped with learning if/else statements and nesting those statements. 

## Day 4
Today was all about lists and using random.

#### [Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_Python/blob/main/rock_paper_scissors.py)
Make a rock, paper, scissors game.

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
I think this tied up the lessons of the day very well. After the previous two exercises this felt straightforward. 

<!-- ## Day 5
Today was about For Loops and Ranges. 

#### [5-1-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-5-1-exercise.py)
You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

Important You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
This challange was hard for me. I thought I understood For Loops in the lecture video but realized I needed more help. I figured out as much as I could on my own, but then needed help. I like to do it on my own, but will use the instructor video if needed on an exercise. However, I always try to be very honest when I did it on my own or with help.  

#### [5-2-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-5-2-exercise.py)
You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.

Important you are not allowed to use the max or min functions. The output words must match the example.

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
After the help I recieved on the first exercise this one came a bit easier. Because there was a lapse in my learning I had forgot about if statements and that made this exercise take longer than it should have. After reviewing the previous days I realized that an if statement would work well here and it helped me solve the exercise. 

#### [5-3-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-5-3-exercise.py)
You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100. Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:

Important, there should only be 1 print statement in your console output. It should just print the final total and not every step of the calculation.

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
This was the first project that used Range and I enjoyed tying together range and for loops. After the previous two challenges this one felt easier. 


#### [5-4-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-5-4-exercise.py)
You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
I struggled with this one, but only because of the math portion of the game. The logic of the if statements and the order needed was easy (I like if statements), but the math functions got me. I need to do a deeper dive into the math functions again. I knew what I wanted to happen, but it took awhile to get there with the math. 


#### [Project: Password Generator](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-5-project-password-generator.py)
There were no written instructions for this project, but the gist was to take what we had learned from the day and build off the provided code to make a password generator. 

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
This project took a LOT of Googleing because I had never used join or shuffle before. The earlier exercises really helped prepare me for this final project. I will say that I want to look more into .join and learn more about it and how it works behind the scenes. 

## Day 6
Today was about While Loops, Functions, and Indentations. The entire day was spent at [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Hurdle%201&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fhurdle1.json) using the Hurdle and Maze exercises. 

#### [6-1-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-6-1-exercise.PNG)

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
This was the first exercise of defining functions and I loved learning about this feature. I can see where this will be super helpful down the line. Through a little bit of trial and error this challenge wasn't really bad. It did take me a moment on the for loop to think about the number of steps, but overall I would say this challenge was more on the easy/medium side. 

#### [6-2-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-6-2-exercise.PNG) 

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
This was the first use of the while loop and the program needed to run until it got to flag and then stopped. I found this task actually easier than the previous because I just needed to tell the program to keep running until false. 

#### [6-3-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-6-3-exercise.PNG)

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
I struggled with this one at first, but that was because I did not know that the use of not was something I could choose to do. Once I figured out using not coding the if/elif statement was easy. I do like that I can use not when making a loop because sometimes that logic is far more helpful than only making a positive statement. 

#### [6-4-exercise](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-6-4-exercise.PNG)

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
I knew what I wanted the program to do, but I didn't know how to get there. I needed the help to know that I needed to add some while loops to the hurdle function. Although, I kept with it I really struggled with figuring out the logic here.  

#### [Project: Reeborg's World Maze](https://github.com/cajewell01/100_days_of_code_python/blob/main/day-5-project.PNG)

###### My Thoughts & Things I Learned
Again, this was something that was hard for me. I'm not sure where I need to turn, but I really think I need to get more practice with logic problems like this. I understand what the code does, I can vizualize what I want to happen, but there is a disconnect for me in turning it into code. This is something I need to improve on because I would like to do this will no help in the future.
